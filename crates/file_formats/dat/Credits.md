It wouldn't have been possible to make this crate without the hardwork of several other people.

I'd like to thank *Armin Preiml* and *Mikko "Tapsa" P* for their work on the [genieutils](https://github.com/Tapsa/genieutils) library whose code assisted in figuring out the structure of the `empires.dat` file. They also stood on the shoulders of giants, and you can see the full list of people they credit [here](https://github.com/Tapsa/genieutils/blob/master/CREDITS).

I'd also like to thank *Scenario_t_c* for his/her [documentation](http://aoe.heavengames.com/siege/DataGraphics/aoedrord_tut_part2.shtml) of several of the `empires.dat` data structures.

Thanks!
