Chariot Palette Crate
-----------------

This crate handles the BIN file format used by Age of Empires (1997).
Currently it can read BIN files.

While the ability to write a BIN file is a nice to have, it's not strictly
necessary for the rest of the Chariot project, and thus, is not implemented
at this time.

The code herein falls under the same license as the rest of the Chariot project.

### Building

You'll need the Rust compiler and Cargo build system. Once you have those,
you can compile with:

```
$ cargo build
```
