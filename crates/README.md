OpenAOE Crates
--------------

Any time a piece of code could be re-used in some other project, whether that
be a modding tool, or another project that's attempting to implement AOE,
a separate crate is split off and placed in this directory.

In each crate directory, there should be a separate README to describe what
the crate can be used for. All crates in this directory have the same license
as the main OpenAOE project.
